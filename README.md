Hi

* Building things here and there with (mainly) Python - from systems to track the ground movement of a particle accelerator to an e-commerce of customizable hair products to an oil flow simulator for underwater pipelines design. How cool is it to be a programmer? :)
* Appreciative of software design, DevOps culture, Linux and the CLI
* Also interested in topics such as productivity and personal knowledge management (PKM)
* Looking to improve my footprint in the digital world with a yet-not-started series of contributions to OSS and (maybe) a digital garden and/or a blog

Cheers üçª
